REGISTERS:

CPU Will have 8 general purpose registers
PC register
Stack pointer register (if stack)
flag register (output of cmp instruction)

flags:

zero flag
sign flag
overflow flag (signed arithmetic)
carry flag (unsigned arithmetic)

9-10 registers

LOGICAL & ARITHMETIC:
CPU will be able to handle arithmetic and logical operations between any two general purpose registers
Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
And, OR, XOR, NOT

JMP INSTRUCTIONS:
first user will run a cmp instruction comparing two values/registers

cmpb (1 byte)
cmpl (4 bytes)
cmpq (8 bytes)
cmp 1,2

then jmp can be called with the location of the jump
jeq <main+0x15>

jeq (jump equals)
jlt (Jump less then)
jgt (Jump greater than)
jne (Jump not equal)
jmp (jump no check)
nul (no jump)

DATA MANAGMENT:
load (load data from memory into register)
save (save data in register into memory)
mov (move data between registers)
lea (load address of memory into register)
