A lottery ticket scheduler

Each program is able to decide its own priority anywhere in the code
A program can choose to be either LOW,MEDIUM, or HIGH priority.
The os will then have a set amount of tickets say 1000 and share them with the
programs based off of the priority. A lotter will then be held for who gets to run next (say every 50 instructions executed)
